              A quality management system (QMS) is a set of policies, processes
              and procedures required for planning and execution (production/
              development/ service) in the core business area of an
              organization. INTERSICA (formerly Socotec Oil&Gas) is dedicated to
              providing value-added resources no mater your requirements and
              expectations. INTERSICA (formerly Socotec Oil&Gas) provides
              properly vetted, experienced and highly qualified technical
              auditors from an extensive global pool of talent and guarantees

            <p>
              Why do you need Quality Support? With growing changes to
              procedures and policies, compliance, conformance, and performance
              will not coincide with your QMS. Auditing of risk and performance,
              KPIâ€™s and follow up on completed corrective actions serve as a
              major role in keeping quality programs, company policies, contract
              commitments and regulatory requirements achieved.
