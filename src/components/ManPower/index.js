              Technical personnel staffing for projects can be a strenuous and a
              time consuming task. Many projects have very little time to
              adequately staff personnel needed while carrying out core business
              functions within the project scope. That’s why INTERSICA (formerly
              Socotec Oil&Gas) is dedicated to providing value-added personnel
              no mater your requirements and expectations. INTERSICA (formerly
              Socotec Oil&Gas) provides properly vetted, experienced and highly
              qualified technical experts from an extensive global pool of
              talent and guarantees exceptional performance.

              Cost flexibility, as it is easier to increase or decrease the
              cost, according to the needs. When personnel type of contract is
              being used, then the cost level matches the real effort. With this
              type of contract the customer usually pays for the seller’s hours
              spent on delivering services, and not for any particular
              deliverables. Less hours means lower cost, and more hours means
              higher cost. Very unlike the situation with the employed project
              manager, when costs are being generated even if there’s not enough
              work for a full-time project manager. This is particularly
              important in volatile times, when demand can go up or down very
              quickly, and consequently organizations are generally more
              cautious in employing new people.

              Experiences are brought from outside and they benefit the
              organization. External experts usually work simultaneously on
              other projects not related to this organization and they bring
              these experiences with them. This is not about intellectual
              capital being stolen, of course. It is about learning from other
              areas and applying these lessons within your organization.
